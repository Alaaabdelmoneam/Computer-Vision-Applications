# Task 2.1 - Building a 3D Model of Coral Head

## Introduction
In this task, we are focusing on building a 3D model of a **coral head** and measuring its dimensions. The task involves several components that need to be modeled and measured accurately for creating the 3D model.

### Components Involved:
1. **Coral Head**: This is essentially an inverted plate with certain specific dimensions.
2. **PVC Framework**: This is a small structure made of pipes installed at the bottom of the pool where the plate is mounted. 
3. **Defected Tissue**: These are square patches applied on the plate with different areas.
4. **Gazebo**: We also require objects with various dimensions that can be built by mechanics. STL files are likely needed for these components.

### Measurements:
- The task involves measuring the following dimensions of the **coral head**:
    - **Diameter of the Coral Head**
    - **Height of the Coral Head** (measured relative to the pool floor, not the plate itself)
    - **Area of Defected Tissue Patches**: These need to be measured accurately.

### Task Breakdown:
There are two main tasks to focus on:
1. **Dimension Measurement Task**:
   - Measure the **diameter** and **height** of the **coral head**.
   - Measure the **area** of the **defected tissue** patches.
   - Each of these measurements will be scored, and the total score for accurate measurements is **15 points**.
     - **Diameter**: 5 points
     - **Height**: 5 points
     - **Defected Tissue Areas**: 5 points
   - The measured values will have an acceptable **error range**. For example, if the diameter is 5, the acceptable range might be 3 to 7.
   
2. **3D Modeling Task**:
   - The second task is to create a **3D model** of the **coral head**.
   - The **3D model** needs to be viewed from multiple angles using cameras to judge whether the model looks correct.
   - You will use the images captured from different perspectives to construct the **3D model**.
     - If the model is created autonomously, the task will earn **15 points**.
     - If the model is created manually, it will earn **5 points**.
   - The **method of dimension measurement** (manual vs autonomous) will also affect the scoring.

## Scoring:
- **Measurement Task** (15 points):
  - Diameter of Coral Head: 5 points
  - Height of Coral Head: 5 points
  - Area of Defected Tissue: 5 points
- **3D Model Creation** (15 points):
  - Autonomous: 15 points
  - Manual: 5 points

## Method:
The methods for completing these tasks will differ based on whether you are using an autonomous approach or a manual one. The details about the measurements and 3D model creation process will vary accordingly.

## Further Details:
For more information on the **manual** and **autonomous** methods, refer to the accompanying documentation.

## Conclusion:
This task is designed to assess the ability to measure objects accurately and use those measurements for creating a 3D model. Attention to detail in both measuring the dimensions and creating the 3D model will be crucial for success.
